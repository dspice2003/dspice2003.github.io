During this week I learned more about github, we also got a programing book that shows us the basics of programming, in that book I learned
how to create a list also how to add and delete lists. In this week we set up our computers for programming, we installed Visual Studio
Code and Python 3.7. We learned how to print "Hello World!" and how to create strings.
